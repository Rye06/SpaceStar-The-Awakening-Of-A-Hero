# Day 2 of My Game!

# What did I do?

The second day, I completed-

Play Screen:

* Formated the Code
* Added a New Bullet Image
* Worked on the Bullet Function

# What am I working on? 

Currently, I am almost done with the working of the bullet being fired from the player's spaceship through the "Bullet" class! Then, I would be looking to develop the enemy spaceship and its spawning.
