# Day 2 of My Game!

# What did I do?

The Second Day, I completed-

Play Screen:

* Formated the Code
* Worked on the Bullet Functioning

# What am I working on? 

Currently, I am almost done with the working of the bullet being fired from the player's spaceship. After finishing that, I am also looking to design a home screen and enable the smooth switching between the home and play screen.
