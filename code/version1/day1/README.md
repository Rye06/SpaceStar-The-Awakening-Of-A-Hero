# Day 1 of My Game


# What did I do?

The first day, I completed-

Play Screen:

* User's control on the spaceship
* Current Chapter Display
* Background Stars 

# What am I working on? 

Currently, I am working on the bullet being fired from the player's spaceship through the "Bullet" class! Then, developing the enemy spaceship and its spawning.

Apart from that, I am also developing-
