# Day 1 of My Game


# What did I do?

The First day, I Completed-

Play Screen:

* User's Control on the Spaceship
* Current Chapter Display
* Background Stars 

# What am I working on? 

Currently, I am working on the bullet being fired from the player's spaceship through the "Bullet" class! Then, developing the enemy spaceship and its spawning.

Apart from that, I am also developing-

* Alert Message if Edge of Screen is Touched
* Implement Enemy's Spaceship Class
* Fix Extreme Left Collision (Extra Increase in X-Coordinate is Seen when Key 'D'/'d' is Pressed)
